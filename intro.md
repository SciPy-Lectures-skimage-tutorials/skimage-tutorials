# Pandas from Numpy

This is a short tutorial series teaching the Pandas data science library,
starting from the Numpy array library, on which Pandas is based.

## Many sections are interactive

You can interact with many of the sections in this textbook, with the
"Interact" button at the top of the page.  This will take you to a free online
service that allows you to execute the code in the section, to generate the
tables and figures.  We encourage you to play with these interactive sections
by changing the code and running it.
